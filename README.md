## Build Process
This project was made so I could get more experience with third party API calls and using the useEffect hook. 

Is uses React for it's framework and React Hooks to manage state and effects. Axios is used for making the GET request to the API, which is found at <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api">CoinGecko</a>. It also uses Bootstrap, mainly for taking care of the responsinve design element of the page.
